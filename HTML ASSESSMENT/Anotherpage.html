    <h1>THE MAIN PART OF HTML</h1>
    <P><ul>
<li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element 
    (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. <br>
    This states where the element begins or
     starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
 </ul></P>
 <p><ul>
    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag,
         except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
         <br> This states where the element ends — in this case where the 
         paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of 
        the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
 </ul></p>
 <p><ul>
    <li>The content: This is the content of the element,
         which in this case, is just text.</li>
 </ul></p>
 <p><ul>
    <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag,
         and the content together comprise the element.</li>
 </ul></p><br>
